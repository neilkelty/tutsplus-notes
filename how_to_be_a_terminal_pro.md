## Introduction

### Hello Terminal
* `echo 'hello word!'` - prints `hello world!` to the command line with a line break
* `echo -n 'hello!'` - will supresses the newline, but it looks like my oh-my-zsh installation doesn't make it look quite like bashrc
* The ~ on a Mac is /Users/neilkelty by default
* Press `Ctrl + A` to go to the beginning of a long line
* Press `Ctrl + E` to go to the end of a long line
* Press the up key to go in my history of command
* Tab-completion - when you start typing out the filename, you can hit `tab` and it will either complete the file path or hitting `tab` twice will give you the options if there are multiple
* Type `clear` to clear the terminal screen - you can still scroll up and see everything, just gives you a blank slate
* Type in `man echo` or any other command for the manual/documentation
